To do this, I'm going to need to understand inheritance properties pretty well.
I'm gonna make a list of what I'm using.
    JFrame
    JTable
    Functions
    KeyListener
    MouseListener
    Timer/repeating functions.
    A lot of inheritance.
So, I really want to have a basic class which will show exactly how one would use my code.
User will need to be able to...
    Add keyListeners && mouseListeners which can...
        take data from the keyboard at any moment.
        Use data to use functions.
        Use data to alter screen data/images.
        change information.
    Change what is shown on the screen.
    ^^To do this, I'm gonna need paintStuff to activate on a timer.
